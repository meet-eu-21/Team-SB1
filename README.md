Topic B : Detection of chromosome compartments

Description of the project: Project of the inter-university collaborative course Meet-EU 2021/2022. It concerns the detection of chromatin compartments basing on Hi-C intra chromosomal contacts maps in different resolutions. We present data pre-processing pipeline, already known and  confirmed detection method of 2 basic chromosome compartments active (euchromatin) and inactive(heterochromatine) , as well as some methods to detect subcompartments and define their optimal number. We evaluate our results by making analysis on gene density and epigenetic marks distribution in particular chromosome. For more information, please check:

Installation and libraries requirements (Python 3): 

- HiCtoolbox.py (please use the version of HiCtoolbox uploaded here and not the original one from Léopold Carron repository, as we made some adjustments necessary so that our main code works correctly !) 
- hmmlearn (https://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#hmmlearn-hmm)
- h5py (https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/) 
- sklearn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- scipy ( https://scipy.org/)
- standard Python libraries ( pandas, numpy, matplotlib,seaborn) 
We installed the specific tools via Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) using conda install  command in the Anaconda prompt. 

Usage:
Datasets:
- Hi-C contact map (we deliver:  chr22_100kb.txt )
- Gold-standard eigenvector compartments detection file ( we deliver: "chr22_VP_100kb.txt")
- Epigenetic marks file ("E116_15.bed")
- Gene density file ("chr22.hdf5" )
